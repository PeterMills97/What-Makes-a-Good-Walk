# What-Makes-a-Good-Walk

	As a keen hillwalker and mountain lover, living in Scotland, I often find myself using the brilliant website: \url{https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/}. It is an outstanding resource, with detailed walk reports, a helpful forum and, personalise-able maps for Munro bagging (the practise of attempting to climb every Scottish mountain over 3,000 feet). One particular feature caught my attention, each walk on the site has an average user rating, this got me wondering, what makes a highly rated walk, could I create a model to predict this? The goal of this project will be to explore this question, primarily as an enjoyable learning opportunity but possibly giving insights into how popular routes might be created.
